# League game server emulator
Yet another lol server,
created with the help of the [LeagueSandbox](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer) code,
written in JavaScript ([nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)).  
This project is being created as just for fun and learn and will be discontinued soon or will be developed very rarely,
anyway making it in JS is not the best idea.  
At the moment, it does not support multiplayer and there is no game flow yet.
